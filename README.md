# Inventory Management System
A Bugle Call Coffee extension site to provide small retailers with an automated inventory management system.

'''

Small cafes, diners, etc. are too small to purchase available sophisticated inventory management software, nor do they need it. Big tech provides big solutions to big problems, but relatively small problems are often left with either solutions that are too expensive or too complex. From market research, I concluded that the majority of small cafes opt to manually keep track of their inventory, which consumes hours of time every week. Enter, my solution for a simple problem of small businesses.

This inventory management system provides a user-friendly interface to effeciently add, restock, checkout, and dispose of any inventory you may have. Every registered, paying account is provided an admin and employee profile. The admin profile is used to make hard edits to the inventory, such as adding a new item or deleting existing items, as well as determining the item's "notification quantity."
