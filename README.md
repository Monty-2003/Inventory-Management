Small cafes, diners, etc. are too small to purchase available sophisticated inventory management software, nor do they need it. Big tech provides big solutions to big problems, but relatively small problems are often left with either solutions that are too expensive or too complex. From market research, I concluded that the majority of small cafes opt to manually keep track of and manage their inventory, which consumes hours of time every week. Enter, my solution for a simple problem of small businesses.

<h4>This inventory management system provides a user-friendly interface to manage inventory, analyze inventory consumption, and automate the restocking process. Every registered, paying account is provided an administrative and employee profile.</h4>

The <b>administrative</b> profile is used to make hard edits to the inventory, such as adding a new item or deleting existing items, as well as determining the item's "notification quantity" and enrolling items in automatic emails to supplier's of specificied items. The current stock of all items is presented on the admin dashboard, and customizable queries are available to generate data visualizations of item's consumptions over a user-selected time frame.

The <b>employee</b> profile is used to register inventory edits as they happen. The employee profiles are granted limited access, only allowing them to register their inventory checkouts.
